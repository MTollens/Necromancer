If the party wants to or needs a home base of some kind, they will first need to spot out a location. and if they plan on a long term rental, will probably have to earn the trust of the landlord

a way to earn trust might be:
	taking care of a pest problem, be it NPCs or actual monsters
	collecting some unpaid loans
	
concerning location:
	there are a few guild halls in the inner ring of the city. 
	and if the party has cleaned out the mansion of the POI (See KING.txt) they may wish to claim the building as their own.
	other options such as buying a one of the old freight trains (and cargo wagons) off of someone who is ready to leave the business.
	etc..

some story thread ideas might be:
	starting a business (duh), perhaps a trading company. since this is a traders market
	discovering a secret of some kind on the property
	I imagine this part will be quite player driven, so use your imagination
