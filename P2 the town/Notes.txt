The Train Tracks Run right through the center of town, there is a central marketplace 
where people of means can spend their coin, every form of craftsmen and traders (the town is more of a trade outpost)
there is a central refined area for the craftspeople and spenders, and an outer area of slums and crime.
a "ring" of armed guards surrounds the spender areas and keeps the riffraff off of the nice cobblestone streets.

if the players do not get thrown out for looking homeless; the inner ring contains any craftsman that could be desired, tradesman, taverns/inns.
`there is a magic items shop / potionary, but the players have to know who to ask. (a hint can be obtained from anyone that seems particularly in touch
`but CANNOT be obtained from anyone that is loyal to the local government)
`the magic shop can only be entered and exited by a secret tunnel under the street that connects to a small tavern or other small low brow establishment
`there is a second version of a (trade stand / equipment store) where the prices are terrible (for the same goods) but the patrons are of a higher class. it is however run by the local government

- some random encounters inside the ring:
	- a noble bumps into a party member on purpose either to start a fight, or to degrade the party member (roleplay)
	- a guard decides to make an example of: (party member / innocent NPC) (roleplay / combat)
	- an NPC thief (of a higher quality than outside the ring) makes a move 
	- they get turned away from an establishment because (race / class / etc...) this could be a good chance for a side event to change the person's mind 
		perhaps the NPC has something wrong in their life that the players could investigate (combat / roleplay)
	- you get the picture	

if the player(s) do get thrown out of the inner ring, they can bully / convince / bribe a local official (NOT a guard) to allow them into the inner ring

outside of the inner ring, there are homeless, and plebians roaming the streets, thugs, small gangs, (use your imagination), etc.. 
- some random encounters outside the ring suggestions:
	- muggers (flavor event, and a chance to get some cheap loot, or wet your sword)
	- the classic "child bumps into a character and steals their wallet" (chance for roleplay, test the generosity of good alligned players)
	- a fire in one of the ramshakle houses with people inside (bystanders are only trying to loot / save themselves) (a chance to be heroic, perhaps find something of value)
	- a "Police checkpoint" for stopping poor people (a chance to pick a fight, or roleplay, or be sneaky)
	- a street fight (add some reason for the fight that may provide something of interest or just a reason to serve some justice)
	- a mugger attacks a vulnerable person (carrying a baby, an old person, etc..) and runs away with something of value (a chance to do something heroic if they want)
	- rabid dog (Flavor event)
	- a sickly person drops dead, looting, rabid dogs move in etc... (roleplay for religious/ spiritual/ empathetic characters)
	- use your imagination
